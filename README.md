# DivRule-Game

## Rules of the game

There is a 3x3 grid in this game, however it is initially empty.
Three consecutive numbers are below that. Only the one on the right can be dragged.
When a number is placed next to another number in the grid and both numbers are divisible by each other, the smaller number disappears and the larger number becomes the quotient.

If the two numbers are, for instance, 6 and 12, then 6 disappears and 12 becomes 2.

As the game goes on, the score is updated. 

The game ends when there are no more numbers that can be added to the filled grid.

Additionally, there is a space at the bottom where you can temporarily store the sequence number and drag it to the grid whenever you want.
